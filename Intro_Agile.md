#Introduction to Agile Methodology

Software development was traditionally based on sequential methods, such as the waterfall method, in which software systems are developed in stages. The software development in these systems proceeded in the following manner:

+ All the requirements of the software were collected from the client in the beginning and frozen.
+ The software system was designed based on the requirements gathered in the previous step.
+	The system was implemented based on the design.
+	The implemented system would be tested comprehensively and rework may be done to fix any issues.
+	Once the software is developed and tested, it is given to the client after which the software must be maintained to ensure that no bugs creep in at a later point in time.

Although this method of software engineering works for smaller systems, it fails when the requirements become more complex or volatile. This model cannot cater to changing requirements and it has been found to deliver buggy and over-budget systems.

To overcome these problems with the traditional methods of software engineering, a different incremental methodology was proposed as early as 1957 [1]. These methodologies were able to handle changing requirements very easily and generated greater customer satisfaction. Many different incremental software development processes were used by developers and in 2001[2], these were collectively referred to as the Agile software process. 

In 2001, seventeen developers gathered at a resort in Utah and wrote the Agile Manifesto which defines the core of the agile methodology [2]. The Agile manifesto reads as follows [3]:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> Working software over comprehensive documentation
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> Responding to change over following a plan
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

The above manifesto was based on twelve principles stated in the Agile Manifesto Website as [4]:

> We follow these principles:
>
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
> through early and continuous delivery
> of valuable software.
>
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in
> development. Agile processes harness change for
> the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> Deliver working software frequently, from a
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
> preference to the shorter timescale.
> 
> Business people and developers must work
> together daily throughout the project.
> 
> Build projects around motivated individuals.
> Give them the environment and support they need,
> and trust them to get the job done.
> 
> The most efficient and effective method of
> conveying information to and within a development
> team is face-to-face conversation.
> 
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
> 
> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
> The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
> to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
> 
> Continuous attention to technical excellence
> and good design enhances agility.
> 
> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
> of work not done--is essential.
> 
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs
> emerge from self-organizing teams.
> 
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
> to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
> its behavior accordingly.

Agile methods are best suited for complex systems with volatile requirements. These kind of systems cannot be effectively developed using traditional software development models. Since most software systems today are extremely prone to change, Agile methodologies are now of great import.
