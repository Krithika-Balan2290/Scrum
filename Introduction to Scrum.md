#Introduction to Scrum:
    Scrum is an agile methodology that can be applied to any software project, however the Scrum methodology is the most popular method that is used. The Scrum methodology is the used for projects with rapidly changing or highly emergent requirements. Scrum software development progresses through a series of iterative cycles called sprint. Each sprint last for one to four weeks. The scrum model suggests that at the beginning of each sprint there should be a planning meeting and concludes with a review. scrum is always thought of as a development methodology but instead it should be thought of as a framework for managing process.
In  Scrum, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project, much of it is left up to the Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented.
    Scrum teams are typically small with 5- 9 members where all team members work towards a common goal.Each team works towards small iterations called sprints. In each sprint there are fixed goals, so the team focuses their entire effort on just that one goal, this increases the quality of the end product. Once the product has been built as per the specification then the product is committed or delivered to the customer.
    if in case the deliverables are not met as per the requirement the left over work is put into the product backlog.
