#Daily Scrum Meeting

Every Scrum Team attends a daily meeting to discuss the progress of the project. These meetings typically run for fifteen minutes in which every member reports the progress that they have made since the last meeting, the work they will be doing before the next meeting and the obstacles in their way. This helps the Scrum Master assess their productivity and try to remove the obstacles and also these daily meetings help eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Scrum Master is responsible for conducting these meetings. He ensures that the rules of the meeting is enforced and that everyone talks briefly. Daily Scrum meetings help the Scrum Master get a better idea of how the Team is working and the probability of its success in meeting the goals of the Sprint. 

The Daily meetings are held in a room called the Scrum room. The people attending the meeting may either be the Scrum Team or other people directly involved in the project. The Team members who are working on the meeting the goals of the Sprint are called pigs while all other attendees who are involved in the project are called the chickens. The pigs participate in the meeting and provide their input and progress on the work. The chickens are not allowed to interfere in the meeting and must follow Scrum rules. The Chickens are only present as guests in the room.

The Team members must only repost what they have done since the last meeting, what they plan on doing before the next meeting and what obstacles they have in their way. They need to keep their answers short and to the point. When talking about what they have done since the last meeting, Team members must only specify which problem was tackled and how far they have come with it. They must not elaborate on how they handled the problem and why. The meeting must not go into specifics of design of the solutions. This allows the Scrum Master to keep a limit on the amount of time to allocate for each meeting.
