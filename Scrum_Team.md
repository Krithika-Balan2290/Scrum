#Scrum Team

Scrum Team is a set of developers who convert a set of user requirements in the backlog to a working product. The Scrum Master initially meets with the Team to discuss the Product Backlog. The Scrum Team then selects a set of requirements that they believe they can implement in the next Sprint. The Team is given full liberty to implement the features however they feel is best. Over a period of Team, the Team becomes more confident and take on many more features to implement than what they started out with.

A Scrum Team is made of members with different personalities, education and job histories and backgrounds. When such different people are put together in a Team, differences will almost certainly arise. These differences must be dealt by the Team themselves, in order to ensure that they meet commitment that they made at the beginning of the Sprint. The Scrum Master must try to stay out of these disagreements that arise within Team members. If the Team does approach the Scrum Master for any such problem, then the Scrum Master must try to resolve the differences as efficiently as possible.

Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle recommend that the size of a Scrum Team be seven people give or take two. A Team size of three is acceptable for small projects, but for larger projects, this would limit the interaction and reduces productivity. A Team larger than eight people would be too difficult to handle and reduces productivity. For larger Teams, the daily Scrum meetings would also take a very long time and leading a larger Team would become cumbersome for the Scrum Master.

A Scrum Team needs to be cross functional. A Team needs to contain members with all skill sets needed to achieve the Sprint goal. Every member of the Scrum Team contributes to solve the problem. The Scrum Team knows its strengths and weaknesses and so, the Team decides the number of features that they can complete in a particular Sprint. The Team as a whole is responsible for doing the analysis, design, coding and testing, irrespective of the composition of the Team.

There is no hierarchy in a Scrum Team. Every member of the Team is equally important and equally responsible for completing the goals that they have committed to at the beginning of the Sprint. The Team works much better if they are better equipped with the resources to complete their tasks. Also Scrum works better if the teams are in open environments. This enables conversations and interactions among Team members and thus, increases productivity.
