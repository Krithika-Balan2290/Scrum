#How does Scrum Work?

There are certain important roles and processes that make Scrum work – a Scrum Master, Product Backlog, the Scrum Team, Daily Scrum meeting and Sprints.

##Scrum master

A scrum master is a management role present in Scrum. The scrum master is responsible for the efficient functioning of Scrum. The scrum master interfaces with the clients to appoint a Product Owner. The product owner then acts as the representative of the clients on the development team. The Scrum Master then talks to the product owner and comes up with the product backlog, plans sprints to deliver the required product and conducts daily meetings to ensure that the team is progressing as expected.

The Scrum Master helps create the Product backlog by talking to the Product Owner and the Scrum teams and then, along with the Scrum teams, plans the sprints according to the features that need to be implemented. The Scrum Master finalizes the duration of each sprint and the number of features that would be implemented in each sprint. Then, the Scrum Master closely monitors the progress in each sprint, through daily meetings, to ensure that the goals are met. If the final results are not as expected, then the next sprint is planned according to the data collected in the previous sprint.

At the daily meetings, the scrum master gets a report from each team member on what has been completed so far. He then compare this with the estimated progress made beforehand and decides on how to act based on whether the team member is on track, ahead or lagging behind. If a team member is on track, then the Scrum Master need not take any significant action. If the team member is ahead, then they can be given additional tasks as needed and if a team member is lagging behind on their tasks, then the Scrum master may take remedial measures such as providing that person with additional help from other team members.

A Scrum Master role can be taken up by the team leader, project manager or any other person in a management position. A person in the role of a Scrum Master must be a focused and stubborn person. The role is not appropriate to everyone. A Scrum Master must be able to handle conflict efficiently and be able to speak for and defend the team if necessary. If there are any hindrances to the team’s performance, the Scrum Master is responsible for talking to the appropriate person and getting rid of the hurdles. This way, the Scrum Master will be able to ensure the highest level of performance from his team.
