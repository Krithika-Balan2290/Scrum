#Sprints

Once the initial Product Backlog is created, the Scrum Team identifies the features that it will be able to implement within a certain amount of time called a Sprint. A Sprint ranges anywhere between a week and a month. Within this time, the Team commits to deliver a certain amount of functionality and it works to accomplish this goal. The Team has a great degree of freedom to accomplish this goal, but it is still constrained by organizational policies and restrictions.

Once the initial requirements are identified and the Product Backlog is created, a Sprint planning meeting is held to discuss what will be accomplished in the next Sprint. This Sprint planning meeting is conducted as two separate meetings. In the first meeting, the goals of the next Sprint are collectively identified by the customers, users, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master and the Scrum Team. They finalize on which functionalities will be implemented in the next Sprint. This list of goals to be accomplished in the next Sprint is called the Sprint Backlog. Once the goals are identified in the Sprint Backlog, the Scrum Team holds a second meeting to figure out how to implement these requirements so that an effective product increment can be delivered to the client.

Once the product goals are identified, the Team is then left to fend for itself for the duration of the Sprint. In this time, the Scrum Team must do its best to convert the requirements into an actual working product regardless of whether or not they know the technology at hand. They will need to learn how to use the technology and build a working software within the given time. In this period, the Team is to have complete responsibility of their work. They act as they see fit in order to deliver the product. No outsider is allowed to tell them how to do their job. No one is allowed to tell them to work on another requirement or project. It is completely left to the discretion of the Team.

The Team has the ability to alter the functionality of the Sprint as long as it meets its Sprint goals. In case the Team is not able to implement all functionalities, they might implement a functionality partially. Any functionality not completely implemented will be entered into the Product Backlog again and re-prioritized. The Scrum Team has two accountabilities during the development process. They must attend the daily Scrum meetings without fail and they must keep the Sprint Backlog updated at all times. The Sprint Backlog must constantly reflect the current status of the system being implemented.

During a Sprint, the amount of work done is constantly measured and this data is used empirically to plan future sprints. If the Team is able to perform more work than they committed to, then in the next Sprint, they will take up a larger number features to implement. If the Team was not able to meet its Sprint goal, then they will take up fewer requirements in the next Sprint. At the end of a Sprint, the Team must deliver some working increment of the overall system. This increments must be tested appropriately to ensure correct working.

In some cases, a Sprint may be terminated before the entire sprint duration elapses. For example, this could happen if the customer decides that they no longer require the functionality being implemented in that Sprint. Another possibility is that the Scrum Team itself cancels the Sprint before completion. This could happen is the Team realizes that it will not be able to achieve the Sprint goal. The Team could also achieve its goals ahead of time and cancel the rest of the Sprint duration.
