#Advantages and Disadvantages of Scrum

##Advantages

1.	Each Sprint results in a part of the system being delivered. So even though the project is not yet complete, the customer receives a part of the system which does work.
2.	Since the duration of each Sprint is small, the time to market for the product is greatly reduced. This potentially increases revenue for the clients.
3.	The system is tested incrementally during each Sprint making the software system highly reliable.
4.	Since requirements can be changed at any point, this allows the customer to make continuous improvements to the proposed system. The developers are also much better prepared to handle unexpected circumstances.
5.	The customer is also highly involved in the development process which makes it highly transparent.
 
##Disadvantages

1.	Scrum is much more difficult to understand and implement when compared to traditional sequential methods.
2.	Initially, since the project even lacks a clear definitions and scope, it may be difficult for the Scrum aster to plan and organize such projects.
3.	As there is a higher focus on working software, documentation can sometimes be neglected. This would cause problems further down the line in case there is a Team overhaul.
4.	Changing requirements and short Sprints could result in an extreme project life cycle for developers not used to Scrum. This could cause them to burn out very quickly.
5.	Daily Scrum meetings last for less than 15 minutes only if the Team members are able to communicate everything they need to convey in a very short span of time. If the Daily Scrum meetings take longer, then they could eat away the developers’ time reducing productivity.
