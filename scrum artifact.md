The primary artifact in scrum development is the product itself. The scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to bring each deliverable to a shippable state at the end of each sprint.
 The product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the list of product backlog that needs to be added to the product. The product owner or the typically the customer prioritizes the backlog so that the most important feature of the product is implemented first. The most popular way to create a product backlog using Scrum is to include test cases which are specific to user functionalities from the customerâ€™s perspective. 
In the Scrum methodology of project management on the first day of a sprint and during the planning meeting team member create as sprint backlog. A sprint backlog a list of requirement that the team is suppose to implement during that particular sprint whereas product backlog is the features to be built which are based on user stories.
The sprint backlog is a list of tasks that the team needs to perform, which were committed to the customer at the time of the planning meeting.
